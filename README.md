# word-guess-game

This is my hangman game. 

## Getting Started

This game is completely comprised of TV characters. It will pick a random one from a list and display its length on screen. Guess all the letters correctly to win the game! When you lose your wins in a row goes back to 0. You only have 12 wrong guesses so good luck!

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to my TA's and my friend for helping me with this one. This one's for the homies.
